## Titanic Ship Case Study

Problem Description: On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding 
with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
 One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not 
enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
 Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of 
people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upperclass.
The problem associated with the Titanic dataset is to predict whether a passenger survived the 
disaster or not. The dataset contains various features such as passenger class, age, gender, 
cabin, fare, and whether the passenger had any siblings or spouses on board. These features can 
be used to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the 
disaster. The dataset offers opportunities for feature engineering, data visualization, and model 
selection, making it a valuable resource for developing and testing data analysis and machine 
learning skills.
